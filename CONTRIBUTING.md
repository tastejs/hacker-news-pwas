## Adding a Hacker News implementation

If your Hacker News implementation meets the [specifications](https://github.com/tastejs/hacker-news-pwas#specification), don't hesitate to put up a PR for it!

## Updating the site

We're exploring using wildcards for our handlers in the `appl.yaml` file but if you add a static file or asset to the repository, you'll have to include it in file in the meantime.

## Testing Service Worker locally

To test the Service Worker locally you can run `npm run dev-sw`.
